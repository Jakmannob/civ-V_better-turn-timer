# civ-V_better-turn-timer
A mod for Sid Meier's Civilization V to improve the turn timer by adding functionality

## Purpose
This mod adds support for stopping and starting the turn timer when playing in multiplayer.
This can be useful e.g. when negotiating peace or taking a short break.

## Usage
To stop the turn timer, the **host** has to click on the turn timer button in the lower middle of the screen.
To start the turn timer again, click on the button as well.

Note, that the turn timer will continue counting downwards, but not progress to the next turn, if deactivated. It will just stop at 0.
When it is activated again, the next turn will immediately begin, so finish your turn in advance. However, you can still play as usual, if it is deactivated.

Non-host players will not be able to use this functionality.
